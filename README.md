# SoftDev-Search
A Code-Answering Project  
By Derry Li and Kaizen Castanos 

A simple project where a user types in a question on the home HTML page, clicks submit, and gets an answer generated. 
The answer is generated based on pulling 10 pages off a google search, converting them to ascii, and then running an algorithm on all ten pages to determine a suitable answer for the user.
